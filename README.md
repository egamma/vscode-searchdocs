# vsc-searchdocs 
Quickly search Stack Overflow or MDN, from VS Code, in your default browser.

searchdocs adds two commands which you can find in the command palette, or with the keybindings `ctrl+alt+shift+s` and `ctrl+alt+shift+m`. If you have selected text, searchdocs will immediately open your default browser to the search results. If you don't have a selection, it will open an input box for your query. You can change this behavior with the `searchdocs.searchWordUnderCursor` setting. If true, it will search for the word under the cursor, when you don't have selected text.
